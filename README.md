We embark on a journey of discovery as we leverage our data analysis expertise to uncover the untapped potential within the Indian startup ecosystem. This project is designed to not only decode the numbers but to distill insights that will guide our team towards a successful foray into this dynamic market

# Introduction

The data used in this project is from 2018 to 2021.
2018 and 2019 datasets were retrived from sql database while 2020 and 2018 data were loaded into the python environment as csv files. Explaratory data  Analysis(E.D.A) was perfromed on each data set
The datasets were then concatenated,cleaned and then analysed as per the hypothesis and analaytical questions

# Hypothesis and Questions
.**Hypothesis**
H0 : There is no significant relationship between funding and the sector

The 2018-2019 data sets were loaded via the sql connector and 2020 and 2021 data were loaded directly into the vs code .After performing E.D.A on each of the dataset,they were concatinated and saved in a csv file.
The concatinated dataset was then cleaned column by column according to the needs of the hypothesis and the analytical questions above.
Visualisations were generated via python and Power BI
